## Libraries Required
The libraries required are written in the txt file.

## Dataset Used
The datasets we used are as follow-
*   [Artist's Style](https://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipythonx/van-gogh-paintings/)
*   [Content Image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lprdosmil/unsplash-random-images-collection/)

## Enhancements for the Future:
* Extend training duration using an improved neural network architecture and a more extensive dataset to enhance overall training quality.
* Explore alternative style transfer techniques to diversify the artistic outcomes.
* Develop a deployable model capable of autonomously generating a unique style based on its training data, eliminating the need for external style images.
* Assess style transfer efficacy using additional metrics specifically designed for evaluating the artistic quality of transformed images.
